/*A company has n offices, each initially isolated. A list of m proposed network cables between pairs of offices is provided. 
Your task is to determine the minimum number of cables needed to connect all offices together (i.e., make the network fully connected).

Each cable connects two distinct offices. Implement a function that returns the number of cables used to form the 
full connection or -1 if it's impossible.

Input Format:
-------------
The first line contains two integers: n and m
The next m lines each contain two integers a and b â€” representing a cable between office a and office b

Output Format:
---------------
A single integer: number of cables used to connect all offices, or -1 if not possible

Example:

Input:
-----
4 3
0 1
1 2
2 3

Output:
--------
3


Explanation:
-------------
n = 4 offices: {0, 1, 2, 3}
m = 3 cables

Cables: (0-1), (1-2), (2-3)

These cables can fully connect all 4 offices (via successful 3 unions)

Hence, Output = 3
