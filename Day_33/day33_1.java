/*In a popular convention center, multiple event sessions are scheduled, and attendees have registered for time slots to enter and 
collect exclusive event goodies. Each session slot has a specific entry fee, which varies based on demand and timing,
and is clearly marked on the registration pass.

A total of N time slots have been booked for different attendees. Some attendees have booked multiple slotsâ€”sometimes consecutively, 
sometimes scattered. After all registrations are complete, the event organizers introduce the following policies:

-An attendee is permitted to attend only one session, and not two consecutive sessions.
-Each attendee is identified by a unique lowercase letter.
-The registration fees for unused or invalid slots will be refunded to the attendees.

You are given:

 A string representing the sequence of registered slots with attendee IDs.
 A list of fees associated with each slot, aligned with the attendee sequence.

Your task is to help the organizers compute the minimum total refund amount that needs to be issued to attendees due to unused 
consecutive bookings.


Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: A string S.
Line-2: S.length() space separated integers, penalty[] points.

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer, the minimum amount to be refund.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
abcccb
3 5 2 7 4 3

Sample Output-1:
----------------
6

Explanation:
------------
There are two slots which are not used by customer-c 
and the cost of immediate slots booked by customer-c are [2,7,4].
So, minimum refund is 2 + 4= 6


Sample Input-2:
---------------
pqrs
3 2 5 2

Sample Output-2:
----------------
0


Sample Input-3:
---------------
llmjjkjj
5 2 4 6 2 6 4 7

Sample Output-3:
----------------
8

Explanation:
------------
There is one slot not used by customer-l
There is two slots not used by customer-j
The cost of the slots booked by customer-l are [5,2]
The cost of the slots booked by customer-j are [6,2], [4,7]
So, minimum refund is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8
