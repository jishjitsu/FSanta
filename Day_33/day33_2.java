/*In a research facility, N signal relay towers are installed in a straight line, each managed by one of three control centers 
identified by IDs 1, 2, or 3. Their layout is described by an array towers[], where each element is a control center ID managing 
that tower.

A set of P signal drones must transmit messages to the nearest tower managed by a specific control center. 
The instructions for each drone are given in instructions[], where instructions[i] = [pos, centerID]. 
Each drone starts at position pos and needs to transmit to the nearest tower controlled by control center centerID.

Your task is to calculate the minimum distance each drone must travel (either left or right) to reach a suitable tower.
If no such tower exists for a given instruction, return -1.

Input Format:
--------------
Line 1: Two space-separated integers N and P, the number of towers and drones.
Line 2: N space-separated integers (1, 2, or 3) representing towers[].
Next P lines: Each line contains two integers: drone's position pos and required control center centerID.

Output Format:
---------------
P space-separated integers, where each number represents the minimum distance the corresponding drone needs to travel.
