/*A Ramanujan number is a number that is equal to the sum of the factorials of its digits.

For example:

145 is a Ramanujan number because:
1!+4!+5!=1+24+120=145

Write a program that accepts:

An integer n — the number of integers to check.
A list of n numbers, and for each number, check whether it is a Ramanujan number.

For each test case:

If the number is a Ramanujan number, output "Yes".
If the number is not a Ramanujan number, output "No".

Input:
-------
A single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

n integers (1 ≤ each integer ≤ 100000) — the numbers you want to check.

Output:
--------
For each number, output "Yes" if it's a Ramanujan number, otherwise output "No".

Each result should be printed on a new line.
