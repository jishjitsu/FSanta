/*Alex, an adventurous mountaineer, loves exploring mountain ranges. 
While on a trek, he recorded the altitude of different points along his journey. 
However, his trip wasn’t a straight climb—some sections went uphill, reached a peak, and then descended.

Now, Alex wants to find the longest stretch of his journey that forms a perfect mountain shape—an increasing climb to a peak followed by a steady descent.

The Challenge
Given an array representing the altitudes recorded during the trek, help Alex determine the longest continuous mountain segment in his journey.

Rules of a Mountain Segment:
It must start with an increasing sequence.
It must reach a single peak (highest altitude).
It must end with a decreasing sequence.
If no such mountain exists, return 0.

Test Case -1 
Input = 2 2 2
Output = 0
Explanation: The altitudes do not form any mountain-shaped segment.

Test Case-2
Input = 1 3 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 8 7 6 5
Output = 11
Explanation: The longest mountain segment is [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5], with a length of 11.

Your Task
Help Alex analyze his trek and find the longest mountain segment in his recorded journey! */
