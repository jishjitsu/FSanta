Object obj = new Object();

obj is a reference to the Object

A string is immutable

but String a = "kmit";
a = "ngit";
this changes the reference in the string pool, as memory is stored in the heap.
Hence strings can be changed as a whole by switching reference but not in parts.

A single Java file can have multiple executable classes, as once we compile a java files multiple classes are compiled together.
We have executable and non executable classes in java, any class with a main method is called an executable class.

Encapsulation - we see a java file is a combination of classes, methods and variables.

An object is an instance of a class.
A class is a blueprint of an object.

Polymorphism is seen as the ability of a method to display multiple properties, through method overriding and overloading.

Inheritance is seen as the ability of a class to propagate, allow another class to inherit the methods and properties of the previous class.
Done by using  class subclass extends baseclass, super.attribute is used to call onto an immediate parent.
Useful in not disrupting code which is tested and deployed, by just inheriting.

Abstraction is done by using private public and protected keywords

There are two types of polymorphism in Java:
compile-time polymorphism.(method overloading)
runtime polymorphism.(method overriding)


Instance and local variables: inside class, inside method, instance variables have default values and local vars dont.

class is a collection of state and behavior

static variables of the print stream: in out error

methods cant be imported

reverse domain used for building package

javac -d . file.java- compiling a package

Constructor, name is same as class, used to create objects, called once an object is created

parameterized, default and copy constructors are available in java
